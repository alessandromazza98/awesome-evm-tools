# awesome-evm-tools

A curated list of awesome tools and resources for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) development and analysis.

## EVM Implementations

### [revm](https://github.com/bluealloy/revm)

It's an EVM written in Rust, super flexible and extensible.

### [evmone](https://github.com/ethereum/evmone)

A C++ implementation of the EVM created and maintained by the Ipsilon team (Ethereum Foundation). It's the fastest EVM as of now, but less customizable than `revm`.
